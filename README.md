# Credit-worthiness--Machine-Learning
In this project, I worked on credit data. The main objective was to predict the creditworthiness(good or bad) of loan applicants. I preprocessed the data by converting to categorical, filling the missing values and converted the data to numeric. Also performed data engineering and by taking correlation of the data, I selected the features for the model. Built Logistic Regression, LinearSVC, Decision Tree, Random Forest and Multi-Layered Perceptron (Neural Network) model for the extracted features. I compared the 5 algorithms on accuracy, precision, recall, F1-Support, and AUC (area under the curve). Also got the top 5 features from Random forest output.
